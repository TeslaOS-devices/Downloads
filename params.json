Therefore, we are moving to a separate repo for Download page, this repo will hold the table of the downloads which is linked with Tesla OS' site using iframe.\r\n\r\nAs in a event, when maintainer want to push up the build to the download section, using a simple entry with table attribute, this would be done.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
