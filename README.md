TeslaOS Downloads
=================

#### What is the purpose of this?

Since, Tesla OS' site is hosted on a private repo. 
Therefore, we are moving to a separate repo for the page, this repo will hold the HTML Tables of the downloads informations, that will be loaded in dynamically using jQuery's powerful .load() function.

As in a event, when a device maintainer wants to push a new build to the download section, he can just add another table row. 

Further optimization will be coming in a week or two, simplifying the entire workflow (and lowering code mistakes).
