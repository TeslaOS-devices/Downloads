TeslaOS Downloads
=================

Why This ?
----------

Since, Tesla OS' site is hosted on private repo. Therefore, we are moving to a separate repo for Download page, this repo will hold the table of the downloads which is linked with Tesla OS' site using iframe.

As in a event, when maintainer want to push up the build to the download section, using a simple entry with table attribute, this would be done.
